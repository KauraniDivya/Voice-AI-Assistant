# Deployment Guide - Voice AI Companion

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Tailwind CSS CDN Warning**
- **Problem**: Using Tailwind CSS CDN in production causes warnings and larger bundle sizes
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed CDN script from `index.html`
  - Added proper PostCSS configuration
  - Created build script to clean CDN references from production build

### 2. **JavaScript MIME Type Error**
- **Problem**: Vercel serving JS files with `text/html` instead of `application/javascript`
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `vercel.json` with proper routing rules
  - Added headers configuration for correct MIME types
  - Ensured static assets are served correctly

### 3. **API Routes**
- **Problem**: API routes not working on Vercel
- **Solution**: 
  - Created proper serverless functions in `/api/` directory
  - Updated frontend to use correct API endpoints

## Files Modified

### `index.html`
- Removed Tailwind CSS CDN script
- Now uses proper CSS imports

### `vercel.json`
- Added proper routing for static assets
- Added headers for correct MIME types
- Configured API route handling

### `package.json`
- Updated build script to include cleanup
- Added proper dependencies

### `scripts/build.js`
- Created build cleanup script
- Removes CDN references from production build

### `postcss.config.js`
- Added proper PostCSS configuration

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build Locally** (Optional):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment issues: Tailwind CSS and MIME types"
   git push
   ```

3. **Vercel will automatically**:
   - Build the project using `npm run build`
   - Deploy the API routes from `/api/` directory
   - Serve static assets with correct MIME types

## Expected Results

After deployment, the app should:
- ✅ Load without JavaScript MIME type errors
- ✅ Display properly without Tailwind CSS warnings
- ✅ Have working API routes for Gemini and ElevenLabs
- ✅ Serve static assets correctly

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify API routes are in `/api/` directory
3. Ensure `vercel.json` is in root directory
4. Check that build process completes successfully
